## Introduction

This Wiki should document all import information concerning the C# pipeline optimization tool.

What this Wiki should be:
  - [a starting point for new programmers with best practices](Programming-Guidelines)
  - [guidelines for testing](Testing-Guidelines)
  - [a place that introduces the basic usage of this library](Basic-Usage)
  - [a source for troubleshooting](Troubleshooting)
  - [documentation for how to get a gitlab-runner working with Halcon](gitlab-runner)
  - [documentation of the commandline tool](Commandline)

Similarily, all bugreports, feature requests relating to the C# application should be made using this repository.

What this Wiki is not: the overall evias documentation. Everything that relates to more abstract project planning belongs in the OPM Kanboard and OpenWiki. Other parts of evias (such as non-optimization heuristic based machine learning, services for communicating with Halcon-Docker containers) are to be documented elsewhere, for example in their respective gitlab repositories.
